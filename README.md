# Python module 03 : Data Quest

A Python project designed for students of School 42.
This module builds on Python foundations and object-oriented concepts, focusing on mastering collections and data structures through the creation of the "PixelMetrics 3000" game analytics platform, following the official Data Quest subject.

This project is an introduction to Python data engineering, covering lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, generators, and comprehensions. It emphasizes efficient data organization, in-memory processing, and command-line communication.
Unfortunately, I didn't understand that comprehension was a thing in python, so I just showed that I "comprehend" how these types work. This project is therefore not complete

Given rules:
- Your code must be written in Python 3.10+
- Your code must respect the flake8 linter standards
- Each exercise must be in its own directory
- Only the `sys` import is allowed for command-line processing
- No file I/O operations are allowed; all data must be processed in-memory
- Your functions should handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes
- Focus on demonstrating collection usage patterns clearly
